MISO does not support mixed read lengths. Please trim your reads to a uniform length and re-run or run MISO separately on each read length. Proceeding anyway, though this may result in errors or inability to match reads to your annotation.
Read lengths were: 36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125
